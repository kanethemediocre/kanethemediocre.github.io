Bases will have a primary type, and supply ratio between goods of that type (some mines might mostly be iron mines, some mostly oxygen etc).
Bases will also have some weight assigned to define local supply of non-primary industries and goods.
Agriculture planets/stations will sometimes have high local supply of water, oxygen, and/or phosphorus, reducing the demand for those goods but reducing their sell price for agro products
Manufacturing planets/stations will sometimes have high local supply of iron, reducing demand for those goods but reducing their sell price for manufactured products.

A few commodities, including Sweet Juice and Tiny Wizards, will have random supply and demant
