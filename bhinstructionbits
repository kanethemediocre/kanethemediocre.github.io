Adding is just counting.  To add one to a number, just count forward once.
5+1 = 6
2+1 = 3

Adding two to a number requires counting forward twice. 67,34
5+2 = 7
2+2 = 4

Adding three to a number requires counting forward 3 times, and so on.
3+3 = 6
5+4 = 9

Adding large numbers by counting gets slow and clumsy, so most people memorize some answers and use other tricks to figure out the rest.  Try adding a few larger numbers like that with just counting.

Now, try using the chart to find the answers.  Match the numbers you want to add with the rows and columns of the chart.



Subtracting is just counting backwards.
