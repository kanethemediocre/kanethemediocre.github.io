				"However, many content changes and additions can be easily implemented with small code changes in the declarations",
				"Many of the most easily editable files start with bh.",
				"For instance, bhblasters contains the definitions for all the blasters in Bling Hustle.",
				"Blaster stats like damage, speed, energy use, cost, or even the number of projectiles can be altered in bhblasters.js",
				"Additionally, the availability and size of upgrades can also be changed just by the numbers in the declaration.",
				"bhstarttree.js defines the first educational bonus material, and can be used to implement your own curriculum.",
				"bhcargos.js defines available cargos, and bhshops.js decides what items are available at which shop in the home system.",
				"homesystem.js, and homeoutposts.js defines the starting solar system, same with trinidadsystem.js, trinidadoutposts.js, napasystem.js and napaoutposts.js.",
				"menusystem.js defines the menu prior to starting the game.  The remaining systems are procedurally generated, although there are parameters to that you might alter as well.",
				"Advanced modders might follow the pattern of trinidad and napa to implement their own new user defined systems and replaced a random system instead of one of the prefabs.",
				"Much of index.html, prior to the update loop, also contains declarations that you might edit for your own purposes."
